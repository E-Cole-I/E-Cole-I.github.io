      Spatial has been an essential tool in the pursuit of power. Today, things have grown past spatial thought and paper maps into a digital world where space dominates. Spatial is not a discrete grouping of technology, but it is part of everything. Whether you're starting a new business or navigating to the closest coffee shop, space plays an important role. Today, we have learned not to think about it, but the technologies that enable our spatial tools are becoming increasingly robust. This will have a prominant role in the development of our future as a planet and it will raise a number of questions. Privacy will cease to exist as we know it, but we will be more efficient as a unit. We are not in this alone and we will continue to become solidified unit.
