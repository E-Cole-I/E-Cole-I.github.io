      I love technology and the unique ways people are leveraging it to tackle problems. WIth technology rapidly evolving and data availability increasing, there will never be a point where the learning process stops. This is exciting for anyone in the field of spatial sciences. New challenges will be present everyday, and it will be up to us to tackle these with new and creative solutions.
      <br><br>
      My academic career has helped me realize the power of geographic information science and the place it has in the world of technology. The traditional view of GIS continuously adapting and changing which makes this field fun to be a part of. My interests in GIS are in enterprise solutions that encompass geographic problems and integrate it seamlessly with non-spatial information.

            Hour of Cyberinfrastructure is a National Science Foundation (NSF) funded project with an aimed objective to deepen student’s understanding and skill sets in regards to cyberliteracy for GIScience. With the importance of data science knowledge and skill sets growing, there is an apparent need to educate and close skill gaps in the future workforce. Through this project, 17 lessons will be developed in the following eight core areas: Big Data, Computational Thinking, Cyberinfrastructure, Interdisciplinary Communication, Geospatial Data, Parallel Computing, Spatial Modeling & Analytics, and Spatial Thinking. As lessons are implemented through partners across the United States through JupyterHub, customized Jupyter Widgets will aid in providing the user with interactive pieces to guide them through the complexities of learning technical material. These widgets provide validation to questions, track user metrics, and log all the information to a central repository. The tracked metrics will act as a proxy to understand how our users progress through each lesson. This approach will not only aid in the creation and adjustment of material, but it will assist in answering how students learn complex technical material. Though this is the foundational stage, this data will be instrumental in the construction of future material to help progress the teachings across different fields. Bridging the gap of skills and refining our pedagogical approach in the production of material marks great promise in the expansion of cyberliteracy across different communities.

            The availability of computing infrastructures such as high-performance and cloud computing, high-speed networks, and rich data has led to a new scientific paradigm using computational approaches, termed computational science. Geocomputation is the "application of a computational science paradigm to study a wide range of problems in geographical and earth systems (the geo) contexts" (Openshaw, 2014). This course will introduce students to geocomputation as well as related areas including big spatial data, and cyberinfrastructure. Students will engage in hands-on exercises learning principles and best-practices in geocomputing. The ability to program is an essential skill for GIScientists. Learning to program takes time and a lot of practice, and in this course students will learn how to develop programs in the Python programming language to solve geospatial problems.

    <p class="menu-travel">
     Throughout my life, I have had the opportunity to travel to different parts of the US and world. I’m indebted to my forever for the numerous opportunities. Being from a small town of 10,000 in rural Minnesota, I lived in a bubble. My parents recognized this and took my studies to the field traveling across the US in an RV stopping at museums, national parks, monuments, and any place that . Looking back at the experience, I didn’t realize how lucky I was to be learning subject matter in the most beautiful places in the US. After living like the Wild Thornberrys for a year, I was re-enrolled in the traditional school setting. This didn’t curb my interest and desire to continue to see the world. So far, I have been to 17 countries and all 50 states of the US. This will continue to grow as I learn more about the world.
