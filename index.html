     Hi! My name is Coleman Shepard, and I’m currently a young adult in the field of geographic information science (GIS). I’m a Minnesotan born and raised, but I don’t play hockey so question is if I’m a true Minnesotan is up for question. Growing up in Minnesota, I found it comfortable to go to the University of Minnesota in the Twin Cities (Minneapolis - Saint Paul). I received a Bachelors of Science (BS) in Geography with a minor in geographic information science (GIS). With a funding opportunity, graduate school became a logical next step. And where did I choose to go? Surprise, I didn’t leave Minnesota. I’ll graduate Spring of 2019 with a Masters of Geographic Information Science and a graduate Minor in Computer Science. I became tired of the traditional way that GIS was viewed during my undergraduate time. Computer Science became a learning outlet that keeps creating new challenges to overcome. Frankly, I’ve grown to appreciate the sink or swim mentality that the computer science has employed. As graduation looms around the corner, the realization of what happens next sets in. What is referred to as the “real world” in academia, can be daunting at first, but becomes more comfortable over time. I look forward to the years ahead and the learning opportunities it presents. If you’re this far in my bio, I appreciate you. Below you’ll find even more information about my life you curious one.

            Hour of Cyberinfrastructure is a National Science Foundation (NSF) funded project with an aimed objective to deepen student’s understanding and skill sets in regards to cyberliteracy for GIScience. With the importance of data science knowledge and skill sets growing, there is an apparent need to educate and close skill gaps in the future workforce. Through this project, 17 lessons will be developed in the following eight core areas: Big Data, Computational Thinking, Cyberinfrastructure, Interdisciplinary Communication, Geospatial Data, Parallel Computing, Spatial Modeling & Analytics, and Spatial Thinking. As lessons are implemented through partners across the United States through JupyterHub, customized Jupyter Widgets will aid in providing the user with interactive pieces to guide them through the complexities of learning technical material. These widgets provide validation to questions, track user metrics, and log all the information to a central repository. The tracked metrics will act as a proxy to understand how our users progress through each lesson. This approach will not only aid in the creation and adjustment of material, but it will assist in answering how students learn complex technical material. Though this is the foundational stage, this data will be instrumental in the construction of future material to help progress the teachings across different fields. Bridging the gap of skills and refining our pedagogical approach in the production of material marks great promise in the expansion of cyberliteracy across different communities.

            The availability of computing infrastructures such as high-performance and cloud computing, high-speed networks, and rich data has led to a new scientific paradigm using computational approaches, termed computational science. Geocomputation is the "application of a computational science paradigm to study a wide range of problems in geographical and earth systems (the geo) contexts" (Openshaw, 2014). This course will introduce students to geocomputation as well as related areas including big spatial data, and cyberinfrastructure. Students will engage in hands-on exercises learning principles and best-practices in geocomputing. The ability to program is an essential skill for GIScientists. Learning to program takes time and a lot of practice, and in this course students will learn how to develop programs in the Python programming language to solve geospatial problems.
